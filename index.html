    What is Origami?

   <div class="Intro para">
    <p>
        Origami (折り紙, Japanese pronunciation: [oɾiɡami] or [oɾiꜜɡami], from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku)) is the art of paper folding,
         which is often associated with Japanese culture.In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
          The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques.Modern origami practitioners generally 
          discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.

    <p> There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
        Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
        Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</p>

    <p>The common city pigeon (Columba livia), also known as the rock pigeon, might be

   <p> 
    Born on October 27, 1858, Roosevelt—often called “Teedie” or “Teddy” by friends—was a frail kid, prone to illness, asthma, and lacking physical strength.
     Despite his modest build, he was an avid outdoors enthusiast, and sometimes carried his fascination with wildlife indoors by practicing taxidermy. At 14, his family went on a tour of Egypt,
      and he traveled with his somewhat macabre tools of the trade, including arsenic. As a teen, Roosevelt put his stuffed birds aside and decided to become aggressive in his physical routine,
       training in gymnastics and weightlifting. Later, he would practice both boxing and judo. The intense interest he showed in combat sports made him a fitness advocate for the rest of his life.
